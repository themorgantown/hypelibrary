# Tumult Hype Library CDN

This readme explains how to use the jsDelvr CDN to load the Hype runtime. This repository also contains files required to create your own content delivery network for <a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro">Tumult Hype's</a> runtime. 

Why? An external runtime URL is useful for delivering high performance advertisements and for leveraging browser cache to speed up your documents. To learn more about the advanced export and external runtime feature in Tumult Hype, [visit this page](http://tumult.com/hype/documentation/3.0/#external-runtime-hosting).

## Use this (Unofficial) CDN:

To use this repository as your own external runtime host, use the URL below when selecting `File > Advanced Export` in Tumult Hype Professional:

**Recommended:**

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/themorgantown/hypelibrary/`

uses [JSdelivr](https://jsdelivr.net) 

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/gh/themorgantown/hypelibrary/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/themorgantown/hypelibrary)**!**

Download <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themorgantown/hypelibrary/master/Hype_CDN_prepared.hype.zip">this Hype document</a> to get started quickly.

<hr>

### Alternatives:

`https://cdn.rawgit.com/themorgantown/hypelibrary/master/` uses [Rawgit's CDN](https://rawgit.com)
or
`https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/themorgantown/hypelibrary/master/` uses Gitcdn. 


## When should you use this? 

Some advertising networks have low file size limits for your uploaded creatives: this runtime URL might help you stay under that limit. Also, if your site loads multiple Hype documents, the Hype Library might be downloading each time a new Hype Document is loaded. Using this CDN will ensure the file is downloaded only a single time.
